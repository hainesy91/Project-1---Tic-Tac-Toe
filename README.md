# Project-1---Tic-Tac-Toe

Player one is Donkey Kong. Player two is Mario. Donkey Kong goes first.

I created 9 buttons in a div, as a gridbox to create the 9 boxes, 3 in a row with 3 rows for the 9 boxes.

I chose to go with a Donkey Kong vs Mario theme as I love videogames and I thought it would be cool to have them vs each other as a theme that fits well with tic tac toe.

I used both Javascript and Jquery to write my code to perform functions, click events and the if statements to iterate over the arrays. I used trello religiously as it was very handy to have to add ideas and tasks to, keep track of them and update with the progress I made. 

I wanted to add sounds to each click from the Mario and Donkey Kong game, some of which I had a leftover from the soundboard project but I didnt have time to implement it into my code.
